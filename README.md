# Google_Page_Ranking_Stochastic_Process
The application of eigwnvalues &; eigen vector 
This project explores the Google PageRank algorithm, which is based on the application of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The algorithm ranks web pages based on their importance and relevance, providing a fundamental understanding of link analysis and matrix computations.
Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors: Core mathematical concepts used to determine the importance of web pages.
Markov Chains: Used to model the web as a stochastic process.
Link Analysis: Evaluates the link structure of the web to compute rankings.
